1. [Clone this repo](#clone-this-repo)
2. [Sign in to your AWS Account](#sign-in-to-your-aws-account)
3. [Install the AWS CLI and auth via the command line](#install-the-aws-cli-and-auth-via-the-command-line)
4. [Install serverless globally](#install-serverless-globally)
5. [Open this project in the code editor of your choice](#code-editor)
6. [Join DevopsRepresent slack workspace](#slack-workspace)

## Clone this repo

Clone this repo. You're going to make it your own and make edits. It's yours to keep and play around.

Choose a directory where you'd like to clone this repo to (it could even just be your desktop)

Run the following in your command line

`git@github.com:DevOps-Represent/simple-lambda-alert-notification.git`

If you don't have a github account, please download the zip by going to the [github link](https://github.com/DevOps-Represent/simple-lambda-alert-notification), clicking on the green `Code` dropdown button and selecting the `Download ZIP` link.

## Sign in to your AWS Account

If you don't already have one, you'll have to set up a personal AWS account. If you don't have one, having an AWS account is key if you intend on continuing your AWS learning journey after this workshop.

- If you DO have an account, log in (preferably not as root and you've set up a user via IAM that has permissions to deploy resources).

  - Create an [IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html)
  - Set up a access key ID and secret by following instructions [HERE](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey). Keep this access key and secret handy. We will need that while calling the secure API.

- If you DONT have an account, go [HERE](https://aws.amazon.com/) to create one, you'll need a credit card - Don't worry no cost will be incured during this workshop (~$1 will be taken out of your account on initial sign-up but this will be automatically refunded by AWS).

## Install the AWS CLI and auth via the command line

As we're running commands via the command line that will allow you to deploy AWS resources, you need to authenticate to your personal AWS via the command line.

Here's install instructions for all operating systems: [How to install the AWS CLI 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)

### Here's the instructions on how to authenticate via your command line:

---

**NOTE** you'll need to get some details from the AWS web console that'll need to be copy and pasted for this to work [AWS instructions on how to configure your command line](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config)

It'll look something like this:

`aws configure`

If you have multiple AWS accounts, configure with a profile name
`aws configure --profile <profile-name>`

Then following the prompts you need to provide:

- AWS Access Key ID
- AWS Secret Access Key
- Default region name (for Australia, choose `ap-southeast-2`)
- Default output format (you can just choose nothing)

## Install node, npm and yarn

- Run `node -v` to check if you have node installed.
- Run `npm -v` to check if you have npm installed.
- Run `yarn -v` to check if you have yarn installed.

if you have everything installed then go to the [Install serverless globally](#install-serverless-globally), otherwise keep reading through.

- To install node and npm go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
- To install yarn, execute `npm install --global yarn`

## Install serverless globally

We are deploying the lambda using [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/). To install serverless via npm simply run `npm install -g serverless`.

<br/>

---

## Code editor

We are going to make a new lambda and create alarms. To do this, it's best to use a code editor.

There's lots of free versions, here's a few to pick from if you don't already have one:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://github.com/atom)
- [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

Here is an even longer [list](https://hackr.io/blog/web-development-ide).
