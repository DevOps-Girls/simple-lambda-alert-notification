# Create a lambda to notify slack

Let's setup the function in serverless. Under functions define a new slack function like this: 

```
  slack-notifications: 
    handler: src/handlers/slack-notification/slack-notification.handler
    environment: 
      SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${ssm:/error-slack-webhook-url~true}
    events: 
      - sqs:
          arn:
            Fn::GetAtt: [<QueueName>, Arn]
          batchSize: 1
      - sqs:
          arn:
            Fn::GetAtt: [<DeadLetterQueueName>, Arn]
          batchSize: 1
          enabled: false
```

### Handler:
This property references Lambda function handler which is the code that processes events.

### Environment:
We can define the environment value `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` by referencing variable using the SSM (System Manager) Parameter Store. The value for the SSM Parameters will be looked up and used to populate the variables. The `~true` means that we want to decrypt the value that's being pulled in from SSM Parameter store. 

### Events: 
The function will be called everytime a message is sent to the `<SNSName>` SNS Topic (remember this happens when the alarm we set up is in a `ALARM` state). We reference (`Ref:`) this by the arn (AWS Resource Name) as this SNS topic doesn't yet exist but is defined in the serverless.yml file we're editing. If an arn object is specified, topicName must be specified as a string, used only to name the underlying Cloudformation mapping resources.

# Send message to Slack
In `src/handlers/slack-notification/slack-notification.js` we're going to initiate the webhook within the handler function. 

```
const url = process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL;
const webhook = new IncomingWebhook(url);

```

Now let's send a message to slack!
```
  (async () => {
    await webhook.send({
      blocks: [
        {
          type: "section",
          "text": {
            "type": "mrkdwn",
            "text": "Whoopsie!! Looks like your lambda had an error."
          },
          "accessory": {
            "type": "button",
            "text": {
              "type": "plain_text",
              "text": "Click here to see logs"
            },
            "url": "https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=ap-southeast-2#logEventViewer:group=/aws/lambda/simple-project-dev-slack-notifications"
          }
        }
      ]
    });
  })();
```

# Let's deploy and test
- Deploy the cloudformation stack again
- Trigger an error using the `cURL` command
- Check the slack channel
